## Why ? How ?
Here is a small modified version of Gyazo, the free version is limited to **7 seconds** of recording unlike the Pro which is **1 minute for gif** and **30 seconds for replay**, thanks to this repository I will not only give you the file to be limited to 3 minutes, but also show you how to re-modify it by yourself later.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Beware, this crack version does not give you access to all the features of Gyazo but the most important so to be able to record a gif or a replay longer.*

## How ?
- To begin with, if you open the gyazo files with **Dnspy**, you may find this part of the code. You just have to change the default values to add recording time.<br>

- Then After change, 180 = 3\*60 = 3 Minutes

**üíô Ps: Sorry gyazo, but paying 5$/month for such a simple feature I find it a bit too daring ^^'**
